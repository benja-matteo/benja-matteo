👋 Hi, I'm Benjamin Matteo from Chile!
🎯 My goal is to create technologies that truly make a difference and help people improve their lives. The best part? There are endless ways to achieve it!

💻 Right now, I'm sharpening my backend skills, with Python as my main ally.

🚀 In the near future, I'm excited to dive into Go and C, especially to gain a deeper understanding of memory management. With Go, I aim to build robust and high-performance backends, leveraging its speed and simplicity.

👥 I love connecting with people and learning from different perspectives. I believe that sharing ideas and experiences always leads to better solutions.
